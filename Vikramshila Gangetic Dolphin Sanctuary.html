         <p> <img src="Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary.jpg" id="image">
      .The Bhagalpur District of Bihar, India, is home to the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary.<br> 
      .The sanctuary is a 60-kilometre stretch of the Ganges river in the Bhagalpur district, running
	   from Sultanganj to Kahalgaon.<br> 
      .Being a riverine habitat, its boundary and expanse keep on changing due to changing geomorphology of the Ganga river.<br> 
      .The sanctuary is named after the well-known archaeological remnants of Vikramshila University, which, along with Nalanda
       during the Pala dynasty, was once a renowned centre of Buddhist learning throughout the world.<br>
      .It was designated as the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary in 1991 and is Asia’s only
	   protected habitat for critically endangered Gangetic dolphins.<br> 
      .The Gangetic Dolphin is the national aquatic animal of India.<br> 
      .The Gangetic Dolphins are also known as Soons by locals and are the main attraction.<br> 
      .They are listed in Schedule-I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and Appendix 2 
	   of the Convention of Migratory Species, and they are considered endangered on the 2006 IUCN
	   Red List of Threatened Species.<br>
      .The sanctuary is also home to a wide range of other aquatic species that are in danger, 
	  such as the 135 species of waterfowl, the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), the Indian 
	  smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata), and other freshwater turtles.
