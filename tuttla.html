         <p> <img src="tutla.jpeg" id="image">
       Tutula Bhawani (also Tutrahi or Titula Dham) is located nearby Tilauthu and approximately 20 Km south west from Dehri-on-Sone. 
	   From north-west and south-east, these are two large mountains.The two large mountains one from north west and another from south
	   east at converge to create a green valley which stretches to 1 mile , there’s a spring fall in the middle and from the middle of the valley a kachuar river flows.<br>  
       All this creates a fascinating scene, from east this valley stretches 300 M wick wharves, from west it shrinks to only 50M from west a spring fall is created which falls from a height of 200 M.
